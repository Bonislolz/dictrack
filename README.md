# dictrack - the dictionary tracker

## A Flexible Dictionary Data Tracker for Condition-Based Monitoring

`dictrack` is a powerful dictionary tracking tool designed for condition-based monitoring and management. At its core, `dictrack` allows developers to easily track and handle dynamic data using flexible components such as conditions, targets, and limiters. It supports various data sources (e.g., `Redis`, `MongoDB`) and offers advanced mechanisms for data caching and persistence.

## Features
- **Multi-Target Support**: Track multiple targets simultaneously with customizable logic.
- **Condition-Based Filtering**: Easily define conditions like key existence, value comparisons, or custom rules.
- **Flexible Limiting**: Use built-in limiters such as `CountLimiter` or `TimeLimiter` to control task execution.
- **Data Caching & Persistence**: Integrate `Redis` for caching and `MongoDB` for long-term storage.
- **Event System**: Includes events like `LIMITED`, `STAGE_COMPLETED`, and `ALL_COMPLETED` for fine-grained tracking.
- **Extensible Design**: Add custom conditions, targets, or limiters to adapt to unique requirements.
- **Python 2 & 3 Compatibility**: Seamlessly supports both Python 2.7 and 3.7+ environments.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Install the latest version of `dictrack` via pip:

```bash
pip install dictrack
```

If you need additional components, you can install `dictrack` with optional dependencies:

#### `Redis` support: For caching data using `redis-py`.

```bash
pip install dictrack[redis]
```

#### `MongoDB` support: For persistent storage using `pymongo`.

```bash
pip install dictrack[mongodb]
```

#### `Gevent` support: For asynchronous task execution with `gevent`.

```bash
pip install dictrack[gevent]
```

#### In-Memory support: For lightweight memory-based caching with `sortedcontainers`.

```bash
pip install dictrack[memory]
```

### Basic Usage
Here’s a simple example to get you started:

```python
from dictrack.conditions.keys import KeyValueEQ
from dictrack.data_caches.redis import RedisDataCache
from dictrack.data_stores.mongodb import MongoDBDataStore
from dictrack.manager import TrackingManager
from dictrack.trackers.numerics.count import CountTracker

# Initialize tracker manager
manager = TrackingManager(
    RedisDataCache(host="redis"),
    MongoDBDataStore(host="mongodb"),
)

# Add a tracker with conditions
tracker = CountTracker(
    name="Demo-1",
    conditions=[KeyValueEQ(key="status", value="active")],
    target=10,
)
group_id = "Robot001"
manager.add_tracker(group_id=group_id, tracker=tracker)

# Feed data into the manager
data = {"id": 1, "status": "active"}
# Process data based on the condition
manager.track(group_id=group_id, data=data)

# Check results
print(manager.get_trackers(group_id=group_id, name="Demo-1"))
>>>[<CountTracker (target=10 conditions=set([<KeyValueEQ (key=status operator=eq value=active)>]) limiters=set([]) group_id=Robot001 name=Demo-1 progress=1)>]
```
